I am a PhD candidate at Trinity College Dublin in Dublin, Ireland. My PhD thesis focuses on the the interaction between elite behaviour, identity and support for political violence. There are four proposed chapters using a combination of new survey experiments, text analysis, multiyear survey data, and interviews.  Dr Gizem Arikan is my supervisor.

In addition to my PhD I have also written a number of other articles on migration, identity, post-conflict politics, political attitudes and African party systems. My research is currently under R&R at the Journal of Conflict resolution with a number of other papers under review. 

Alongside my academic research I am also supporting a project with the Northern Irish government to understand the experience and response to Syrian refugees settled in Northern Ireland. As part of this we conducted interviews with Syrian refugees and host communities who supported their settlement, and also ran a survey experiment to understand how the general public respond to hearing refugee stories. We are currently writing a policy recommendations report and a number of academic publications from the data.
