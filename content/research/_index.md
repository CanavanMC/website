## R&R Papers
* The effect of migration on political support for co-ethnics: Evidence from Turkey *Journal of Conflict Resolution*  (with Oguzhan Turkoglu) 

*ABSTRACT*: In recent years a record number of people have been forcibly displaced or migrated due to conflict. Whilst established political science research suggests that displaced communities are an added risk factor for conflict due to their support for extreme co-ethnic political parties and movements, this has been challenged by recent research which shows that migrants can be a moderating force. We offer a potential reconciliation of these divergent findings by distinguishing between first- and second-generation migrants. Due to their relative lack of conflict exposure, second-generation migrants will have significantly less support for co-ethnic political parties than first-generation migrants and those who remain. We test our argument using granular survey data comparing Kurds who migrated out of the conflict zone in Turkey with those who remained. The results support our theoretical framework and have important implications for our understanding of migrant attitudes and the long term effects of conflict exposure.


## Working Papers
* Violence Begets Violence: Violent Riots Increase Support for Political Violence, but Only Among Co-partisans (with Oguzhan Turkoglu) (Under Review)

*ABSTRACT*: What effect do politically motivated violent riots have on support for political violence? Existing research suggests that exposure to violence can have a detrimental effect on intergroup attitudes and increase support for extreme right-wing parties, however, there is limited research of the effect on support for political violence. Furthermore, analysing the impact of political violence on attitudes is particularly challenging given it is difficult to fully replicate actual political violence in an experimental setting. This paper takes advantage of a survey which was in the field before and during the most significant politically motivated violent riots Northern Ireland has seen in over 20 years, providing a unique quasi-natural experiment. Analysing changes in support for political violence before and after the onset of riots, the results show a significant increase in support for violence among co-partisans of those instigating the riots, but no effect among rival partisans. Further analysis suggests that although some of this effect is mediated by changes in norms, grievances, and perceived threat of out-group violence, there is a direct effect of violence which cannot be explained by these mechanisms.

* Legitimization-by-Association: The Political Consequences of Peace Talks with Rebel Representatives (with Oguzhan Turkoglu) (Under Review)

*ABSTRACT*: Negotiations are the primary mechanism for peaceful resolution of conflict and are significant political events, attracting intense media coverage and public speculation. Whilst existing studies have focused mainly on the determinants of successful negotiations or the impact peace agreements have on post-conflict stability, there has been very limited empirical analysis of the independent impact of peace talks, irrespective of their outcome. This paper seeks to address this gap by arguing that peace talks are likely to increase public support for the political wings of rebel groups, an effect brought about by two primary mechanisms: legitimization by direct government engagement and changing media coverage. We test our argument through an analysis of peace talks in two cases with very different political, demographic, social, and economic contexts: the successful resolution of conflict in Northern Ireland, and failed peace talks in Turkey. Using a combination of granular survey data, election results, and process tracing of key events, we show that peace talks significantly increase support for the political wings of rebel groups in both countries, an effect which is partially sustained even after the failure of the talks. Sentiment and topic analysis of newspapers indicates that significant discontinuities in newspaper coverage may be a key mechanism for this effect. The paper opens up an important new research agenda in civil conflict by highlighting the strategic and political significance of peace talks irrespective of their outcome.

* Effect of Group Status and Conflict on National Identity: Evidence from Post-Brexit Northern Ireland (with Oguzhan Turkoglu) (Under Review)

*ABSTRACT*: National identity remains one of the most potent forces in global politics, yet surprisingly little is known about processes of national identity formation and change. This paper argues that national identity preferences are susceptible to fluctuations in group status but constrained by conflict experience. Exploiting the unique political context in Northern Ireland, we use a diff-in-diff model to estimate national identity preferences before and after the EU referendum. The results show that around 20% of Protestants who did not experience conflict shifted from British towards Irish identity after the referendum. However, for those who experienced violent inter-group conflict, there is a `permanent distance' between groups which fixes identities irrespective of changes in status. The results have important implications for our understanding of national identity, particularly in post-conflict societies.

* The Economic Limits Of Empathy? Analyzing Variation in the Attitudes of Oppressed Minority Groups towards Refugees (with Ahmet Icduygu and Oguzhan Turkoglu) (Under Review)

*ABSTRACT*: How do group characteristics differentially moderate attitudes towards refugees on humanitarian, sociocultural, and economic issues? Building on recent research on group empathy and perspective-taking, we argue that oppressed minority groups will display more positive attitudes towards refugees than dominant majority groups due to empathy triggered by a shared experience of oppression. However, there are economic limits of empathy. Specifically, the empathetic response will not extend to attitudes regarding the economic impact of refugees due to the perceived zero-sum nature of economic competition. Analysis of granular data in Turkey supports the argument, with Kurds (i.e., oppressed group) displaying more positive attitudes on sociocultural and humanitarian issues but not economic. The generalizability of this argument is underscored by a similar analysis of European Social Survey data from 37 countries. The results highlight the importance of group characteristics in understanding attitudes towards refugees, particularly how views vary across groups and topics.

* Are African Party Systems Exceptional? Ethnicity, Elections, and Party System Nationalization in Comparative Perspective (with Shane Mac Giollabhuí) (Under Review)

*ABSTRACT*: How does ethnicity matter in the development of party systems in sub-Saharan Africa? The prevailing view is that the European colonial occupation bequeathed to Africans an institutional legacy that made ethnicity, rather than class or other cleavages, the continent’s most salient political cleavage. And yet, in spite of ethnicity's evident importance -- and despite the fact that African societies are, on average, \textit{twice} as diverse as other regions of the world -- African party systems are no less fragmented, or nationalized, than other regions of the world. What can explain this puzzling incongruity? We answer this question using a new dataset of 138 elections in 37 African countries (1960–2019). We find that geography provides a far more compelling answer than a narrow head-count of ethnic groups, and that electoral institutions – if classified and measured carefully – play a subtle, but significant, role in the formation of party systems.
